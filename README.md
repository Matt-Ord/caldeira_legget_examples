# Caldera Leggett Model

Exploration into the Caldera Leggett Model on a periodic surface.

To Run the examples, you will need to

- Install Debian/Ubuntu in wsl
- Install Docker and Vs Code
- Clone the repo in wsl, and then ctrl+shift+p to reopen in container. This might require you to install the 'Dev Container' extension first

The container should then build. This will install all necessary dependencies.

All examples can be found in `examples/` folder. `examples/periodic.py` in particular is a simulation in a 1d cosine potential.
